Karavi Topology is part of the Karavi open source suite of Kubernetes storage enablers for Dell EMC products.

Karavi Topology provides Kubernetes administrators with the topology data related to containerized storage that are provisioned by CSI (Container Storage Interface) Driver for Dell EMC storage products.

## Topology Data

This project provides Kubernetes administrators with the topology data related to containerized storage. This topology data is visualized using Grafana.
