Karavi Topology is part of the Karavi Observability storage enabler, which provides Kubernetes administrators standardized approaches for storage observability in Kuberenetes environments.

Karavi Topology provides Kubernetes administrators with the topology data related to containerized storage that is provisioned by CSI (Container Storage Interface) Driver for Dell EMC storage products.

## Topology Data

This project provides Kubernetes administrators with the topology data related to containerized storage. This topology data is visualized using Grafana.

## Building the Service

If you wish to clone and build the Karavi Topology services, a Linux host is required with the following installed:

Once all prerequisites are on the Linux host, follow the steps below to clone and build the metrics service:

1. Clone the repository using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/dell/karavi-topology.git`
1. Set the DOCKER_REPO environment variable to point to the local Docker repository, for example: `export DOCKER_REPO=<ip-address>:<port>`
1. In the karavi-topology directory, run the following command to build the Docker image called karavi-topology: `make clean build docker`
1. To tag (with the "latest" tag) and push the image to the local Docker repository run the following command: `make tag push`

__Note:__ This only supports Linux. If you are using a local insecure docker registry, ensure you configure the insecure registries on each of the Kubernetes worker nodes to allow access to the local docker repository

## Testing Karavi Topology

From the root directory where the repo was cloned, the unit tests can be executed by running the command as follows:

```console
make test
```

This will also provide code coverage statistics for the various Go packages.
